# Game of Life

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in the Go programming language.

## Introduction

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its progression is determined by its initial state, with no further input. The game consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. The game evolves in discrete steps according to a set of rules.
